Tye F.
  5:29 PM

Dmytro
  8:19 PM
Hi, 
@Tye F.

I didn't receive payment yet. when paid, please send message.


Tye F.
  8:24 PM
if will be done by EOD, no worries
8:29
Tye,
You need to figure out how to meet this migration deadline.
You have the source code, it may be as simple as changing connector setups to get us up and running.
As for the re-write that can take an extra week or two, but we must achieve functionality when we migrate.
Please advise.
Thank you,
Eric
8:29
this is from client
8:29
:worried:
8:31
does that make sense?


Dmytro
  8:36 PM
deadline is Oct 18 ?
8:36
:disappointed_relieved:


Tye F.
  8:36 PM
I think that we can run current programs without rewrite
8:36
he's saying to just change connectors


Dmytro
  8:37 PM
what do you mean ?
8:37
we need convert to web version
8:37
it was old vb code


Tye F.
  8:38 PM
currently it's working now, but they are migrating to Azure


Tye F.
  8:45 PM
he is saying that they can be migrated and working how they are now, and we can still work on re-write of them


Dmytro
  8:50 PM
I am not sure what they mean ?


Tye F.
  8:52 PM
so they will need to point to cloud server instead of on premisis server
8:52
what he means by "changing connector"


Dmytro
  8:53 PM
don't need web version ?


Tye F.
  8:53 PM
yes, still need rewrite


Dmytro
  8:53 PM
vb code ?


Tye F.
  8:54 PM
the vb code I gave you is source code for existing programs that are in Remote12
8:55
they are moving to Azure cloud instead of on-premises server


Dmytro
  8:57 PM
I am developing new website
8:57
:cry:


Tye F.
  8:59 PM
yea, what you are developing will be on new URL(s) (edited) 


Dmytro
  9:02 PM
what do you mean this ?
image.png
 
image.png
9:02
after rewrite, will do website ?


Tye F.
  9:03 PM
re-write = web version
9:04
I think he's right though, they can migrate everything and we can finish building ASP sites and they can deploy when completed


Dmytro
  9:04 PM
For now, working for it
9:05
where is code for last dev ?
9:05
we need to develop from first


Tye F.
  9:05 PM
?


Dmytro
  9:05 PM
as you know
9:05
Then, what is my work for now ?
9:05

Tye F.

Dmytro
  7:01 PM
yes, please


Tye F.
  7:01 PM
the programs that you are re-writing are already on the remote12 server right?


Dmytro
  7:02 PM
no


Tye F.
  7:02 PM
hmmm
7:02
how are they using the programs now?


Dmytro
  7:02 PM
send me link
7:07
What is working on remote12?
7:09
Do you mean https://app.staffzone.com/ ?


Tye F.
  7:10 PM
no, ugh so confused
7:10
let me see how they are using these 4 programs now
7:10
then I want to know if we can make it work on their server migration
7:11
this doesn't effect the re-write work that you are doing


Dmytro
  7:12 PM
What is problem for now, there is builder version for dev, it is not source code, so I can't customize https://app.staffzone.com.


Tye F.
  7:13 PM
not talking about app.staffzone.com


Dmytro
  7:13 PM
If there is 4 programs, then same.
7:13
only builder version for dev
7:14
anyway, send me links for 4  programs.
7:15
let's me check again


Dmytro
  7:27 PM
Are you there ?
7:28
If there is source code, then will be easy
7:29
This is prototype for web version
image.png
 
image.png


Tye F.
  7:37 PM
I already sent you source code for the 4 programs
7:37
you're talking about app.staffzone.com ?


Dmytro
  7:37 PM
I mean web version what they are using
7:37
they using vb or web version ?
7:38
I am checking and developing by logic of vb code
7:38
I am confusing


Tye F.
  7:38 PM
right


Dmytro
  7:38 PM
Then, what is working now on server ?


Tye F.
  7:39 PM
I'm trying to get him to point me to them


Tye F.
  7:54 PM
image.png
 
image.png


Dmytro
  7:57 PM
These are not source code
2 files
 
image.png
image.png


Tye F.
  7:58 PM
they are compiled vb code right?


Dmytro
  7:58 PM
maybe
7:58
Got link what they are using ?


Tye F.
  7:59 PM
this is what they are using, desktop applications


Dmytro
  7:59 PM
omg
8:00
:disappointed_relieved:


Tye F.
  8:00 PM
haha, it's why you are creating web apps


Dmytro
  8:00 PM
:star-struck:
8:00
yes


Tye F.
  8:03 PM
so I think we will need to setup Azure virtual desktop to migrate these existing applications then (edited) 
8:04
and it would work temporarily while we are building the web apps
8:04
is that possible?


Dmytro
  8:09 PM
There is any web version on server ?
8:09
What is requirement from client in detail ?
8:10
last dev implemented https://app.staffzone.com?


Tye F.
  8:10 PM
right
8:11
the requirement is to create web version of those 4 programs
8:11
but they want to be able to use their desktop apps on new Azure server in the mean time
8:15
oct 19 they are moving the db's to Azure
8:16
so I think the solution if we don't have the web versions complete is to use Azure virtual desktop for those 4 existing desktop applications
8:16
while we finish the web versions (edited) 
8:16
make sense?


Dmytro
  8:23 PM
Do you know information for Azure ?
8:27
I don't think Azure Database is there yet.


Tye F.
  8:28 PM
right
8:29
I just want to make sure this is possible


Dmytro
  8:29 PM
For now, they are using vb code ?


Tye F.
  8:29 PM
desktop app, yes


Dmytro
  8:30 PM
It is not working ?


Tye F.
  8:30 PM
yes, it's working


Dmytro
  8:30 PM
do you mean after install Azure ?


Tye F.
  8:30 PM
yes


Dmytro
  8:30 PM
after install Azure, then let me know (edited) 
8:30
I will change connection information


Tye F.
  8:30 PM
GREAT!


Tye F.
  11:32 PM
The programs are installed on an Azure Virtual Desktop

9:37
when user try to save, it need username
9:37

Hi


Tye F.
  5:16 PM
I got a question from StaffZone
5:16
"I need to get the 4 programs connecting to new Azure SQL on the the other Azure Virtual desktops. Do you have an MSI or can I copy over the working .exe?"


Dmytro
  5:37 PM
For now, I don't have MSI
5:37
Please copy over

Dmytro
  8:01 PM
I have a question


Tye F.
  8:07 PM
sure


Dmytro
  8:09 PM
I have checked database, but can't find db for login with username and password.
image.png
 
image.png
8:09
Do you know about it ?
8:10
or, can I make new db for login ?


Tye F.
  8:10 PM
I will ask about it


Dmytro
  8:11 PM
Actually, it is very poor question because last dev worked on it already for a long time.


Tye F.
  8:12 PM
you are right...


Dmytro
  8:12 PM
Don't have other way ?
8:13
Maybe I make new db for login ?


Tye F.
  8:14 PM
I will ask, it's ok


Dmytro
  8:14 PM
For now, almost completed Everify Audit 2019-CentralizedDB
8:15
If complete with login part, then will save data with selected SSN and username
8:15
for now, only need username to save ...


Tye F.
  8:17 PM
I asked if they want new db or if they want to use existing one, if so which one


Tye F.
  8:40 PM
"I’m not sure which database they’re using. Now I think they use a security group like the disciplinary form and active directory to authenticate using the programs. Can we make the programs logged in like we do with the disciplinary form in the web console for the kiosk system?"
8:40
"Does that make sense?"


Dmytro
  8:42 PM
@Tye F.
 Actually, I know  web console for the kiosk system have login process,
but If we have code, then no problem
8:43
we don't have env of last dev's  code
8:43
image.png
 
image.png
8:43
anyway, let's me think
8:44
and it is not big problem
8:44
after complete, maybe need change connection with db


Tye F.
  8:45 PM
ok, there will need to be work done on those programs as well
8:45
they are web based programs so the code is on one of those machines


Tye F.

There is a program Clarke wrote that I need help with. It runs a few crystal reports that the data gets pulled from the SZWageHistory table. I think it just needs to be recompiled with a new version to work on the AVD windows 11 machine.
Eric has shared the source code. It will need to connect to the Azure SQL managed instance.
The program and reports can be found on the AVD-Branch-0 machine you accessed for reconnecting the 4 programs.
C:\HVI\WageHistoryReports\ReportDriver.exe
Below is the error when I click a button in the program.

If you are trying to connect on 1433 you will not be able to. Please adjust your connection to use port 3342 if you have not already. My previous email included a screenshot of the NSG allowing external traffic to the public instance. Provide screenshots or further details on how you are trying to connect. Weekend support for this matter will be limited so this may be my last response until Monday. Thank you.

Dmytro
  8:54 PM

Dmytro
  8:56 PM
or need any update for rewrite 4 programs ?


Tye F.
  8:56 PM

8:57
he's talking about the existing web programs


Dmytro
  8:57 PM
"Could give us an update on anything you need for the migration this weekend/next week please? I am trying to get the Order of Operations for the migration."
8:58
I am not sure what mean this


Tye F.
  8:58 PM
there are applications that run on websites
8:58
like app.staffzone.com


Dmytro
  8:59 PM
I know


Tye F.
  8:59 PM
they are migrating these to Azure cloud
8:59
do we need anything else to help them get it done


Dmytro
  8:59 PM
oh ... got it
8:59
so, for migration with Azure cloud
9:01
We will need to redeploy the code with a new connection to the database.
9:02
So, at first, need all code, but I don't have any code for it for now as you know.


Tye F.
  9:03 PM
the code should be on the server...


Dmytro
  9:03 PM
it is build version, it is not source code


Tye F.
  9:03 PM
for the websites?


Dmytro
  9:03 PM
yes
9:04
it is asp.net project as you know, asp.net need to deploy builder version to server
9:04
not source code


Tye F.
  9:04 PM
:worried:


Dmytro
  9:06 PM
Do you know about server that have deployments for app.staffzone.com?


Tye F.
  9:06 PM

9:09
ugh, what a mess!


Dmytro
  9:10 PM
@Tye F.
 got it
9:11
for now, if they need migration with Azure, I will help it
9:12
to change connection with Azure, it is possible, but impossible to fix code.
9:12
understand ?


Tye F.
  9:13 PM
so we can't update the tax documents etc.?


Dmytro
  9:14 PM
for now, I need develop it from first
9:14
anyway, if we have source code, then it is no problem
9:14
please ask client about source code
9:14

Tye F.
  9:15 PM

Dmytro
  9:15 PM

Dmytro
  9:17 PM

9:35
only that question


Tye F.
  9:38 PM

I thought the challenge was for item 3... I thought it would be easy in 30 hours.
But the challenge I just checked is item 1, and it's very difficult in 4 items. For item 1, I think 40 hours is appropriate.


Tye F.
  11:04 PM
:disappointed:


Dmytro
  11:04 PM
impossible ?

it is very difficult in 4 points

"Good Morning Tye,
Eric thinks he found the source code for app.staffzone.com. It is currently being moved in the sharefile and should be available in about 30 mins. It’s named something like HVI app 2019. Check and see if that’s what you are looking for.
Can you upload a copy of the code for the connectors you changes on the four programs? Github Staff Zone git hub is fine if you don’t have upload permissions to the sharefile eric has been using.

I think they might have found old code
12:18
should be available in 20 min
12:18
I will send it over once it's ready


Dmytro
  12:26 AM
hello, 
@Tye F.
12:26
changed config file
12:26
But as I said before, you need to allow the IP to try the Azure server from the server. (edited) 
12:27
Do you remember it ?
12:27
if allow ip, then will work https://app.staffzone.com
12:29
please contact client about it
12:30
I'm sick right now and will be back in a few hours.


Tye F.
  12:30 AM
?
12:31
everything is moved to Azure server
12:31
what IP?


Dmytro
  12:32 AM
on logmain server, we need attempt to Azure
12:32
so, logmein ip is 95.216.224.99
12:32
we need allow it on Azure
12:32
do you remember before ?


Tye F.
  12:32 AM
that server is going offline, why they migrated everything
12:33
I think you are trying to run the program from remote machine on Azure server


Dmytro
  12:33 AM
I mean attempt to Azure database server


Tye F.
  12:34 AM
ugh


Dmytro
  12:34 AM
from server


Tye F.
  12:34 AM
logmein is on prem remote machine
12:35
they migrated everything to Azure cloud right?
12:35
so we need to make sure everything works from there


Dmytro
  12:36 AM
then, give access to Azure cloud
12:36
for deploy app.staffzone.com
12:36
KioskWeb1
12:36
as you know, all server code working on there
12:37
just change from localhost to Azure in connector


Tye F.
  12:37 AM
I will tell them to allow that IP and not take down the on prem server yet...


Dmytro
  12:38 AM
do you know Azure cloud ?
12:38
to access


Tye F.
  12:38 AM
all I have is the SQL instance


Dmytro
  12:39 AM
we have SQL all, but don't have server to deploy builder version
12:39
do you  understand ?
12:39
only have KioskWeb1 to deploy code
12:39
with access
12:40
we need website run on KioskWeb1 with connector Azure cloud
12:40
right ?


Tye F.
  12:41 AM
I don't think anything is going to run on that remote machine after migration
12:41
anyway I will tell them to allow the IP for now and keep it up until we can move it
12:41
I think it's the only option


Dmytro
  12:41 AM
anyway, we need move deploy server with code, then give me all permission for it
12:42
please discuss with client again
12:42
anyway, we solved a way with trouble today
12:42
we can do ....
12:43
@Tye F.
12:43
I am sick now, will be back after some hours.
please leave message here
12:43
okay ?


Tye F.
  12:44 AM
:weary: ok...
12:44
feel better


Dmytro
  12:45 AM
I'm tired from working full time on 4 programs...
12:45
anyway, don't worry
12:45
I will do best for you


Tye F.
  12:45 AM
if they move the code then it will still work right?


Dmytro
  12:46 AM
I have changed only for https://app.staffzone.com/
12:46
web.config
12:46
it will work
12:46
with azure


Tye F.
  12:47 AM
ok, I think I'm confused
12:47
anyway I've asked them to allow that IP


Dmytro
  12:47 AM
thanks I will be back after some hours


Tye F.
  12:47 AM

Tye F.
  4:52 PM
Ah ok


Dmytro

You changed for kioskweb console already? (edited)

If we don't have code, then need develop again


Tye F.
  11:46 PM
ugh, that sucks
11:47
what do you think it would take to develop again?
11:50
please be kind, I will have to pay for it 100% loss to me unfortunately


Dmytro
  12:04 AM
for all on above ?
12:04
there are 5 websites ...
12:05
I don't know all , but checked app.staffzone.net a little
12:05

12:06
Could you tell me about time with last dev ?

Tye F.
  12:23 AM

12:23

12:27
what is best option for project ...


Tye F.
  12:28 AM
the best option is to solve the problem faster of course
12:28
I think it's going to have to be redeveloped anyway if they want to make changes etc. anyway though right?

12:39
it need change design and functions


Tye F.

it was already there before, I think it was removed


Dmytro
  12:40 AM
I think it is not exist

How about re-developing Staffzone and Canada projects? (edited) 
11:30
And working as well on reports site ?


Tye F.
  11:46 PM
I think once we complete the 4 program rewrites, I will discuss more works with them
11:46
nothing from Canada company unfortunately :disappointed:


Dmytro
  11:48 PM
Do you remember report driver vb code issue ?


Tye F.
  11:51 PM
yea, that is next


Dmytro
  12:31 AM
Are you there 
@Tye F.


Tye F.
  12:31 AM
yea


Dmytro
  12:32 AM
I have checked video in detail, so they want to show merge list with cart and selected product on product page.
12:33
but ordinary, that page is to add cart actually, so after confirm selected product list, will add to cart
12:34
so, in cart page, will show total price and list to order
12:34
of coz, different price between product page and cart page
12:34
do you understand what I mean ?
12:38
image.png
 
image.png
12:38
do you think it is right logic ?


Tye F.
  12:39 AM
I think so


Dmytro
  12:39 AM
hmm...
12:40
on that site, logic is normally.
12:42
so, if they want merge, we need fix many code.
and maybe get confuse
12:42
Actually, it is page to add cart
12:42
not cart page
12:42
think once on normally site


Tye F.
  12:42 AM
yea maybe don't merge


Dmytro
  12:43 AM
why they need merge ?
12:43
it is wrong logic
12:43
if they want it, I will do it, but I think it will take more time
12:44
as you know, my dev worked over 2 weeks
12:44
and current logic is right for now
12:44
once discuss with client
12:47
impossible discuss with client ?
12:48
are you there 
@Tye F.
?
12:49
so, we have developed trigger with cart already when click "select".
12:50
but, they want all merge with product and cart page
12:50
I need to go dinner, please leave your idea and client
12:51
it is depend on you and your client
12:51
I will do by request.

Dmytro

We have a problem with 4 programs that I need to rewrite.
So I haven't completed the login part yet because I don't know the information about the login auth.
For now, I have statically set "TyeF/123456" to login.
10:42
anyway, I will try to find source code and implement auth for login


Tye F.
  10:43 PM
Ok thanks


Dmytro

Good morning 
@Tye F.


Tye F.

I have a question
6:03
Did the report driver program work exactly before client moved the database to Azure?
6:04
on AVD-Branch server


Tye F.
  6:19 PM
I'm not sure, I will ask about it


Dmytro
  6:37 PM

I'm here


Dmytro
  6:31 PM
I am trying to get the source from the server, but there is no exist source code.
6:31
So I am working hard to make the project perfect.
6:31
In the meantime, I am trying to get the source code through decompiling, but it takes a long time.
6:32
We need to continue supporting the SZ project.
6:32
Without the source code, we can't solve any problem.
6:32
Anyway, I will do my best for the project.


Tye F.
  6:33 PM
ok, how about Report Driver?


Dmytro
  6:34 PM
working on server, but it will take more time because it have many problems.
6:34
updated 4 programs code
6:34
I am doing best
6:37
Have you discussed the redevelopment with the client?


Tye F.
  6:40 PM
no, I will just let them know about it today


Dmytro
  6:42 PM
Please tell client honestly


Dmytro
  6:48 PM
If the customer does not agree, we cannot completely satisfy the SZ project, and even 4 rewrite projects is difficult to make perfectly  with login auth.


Tye F.
  8:03 PM
I let them know you are continuing work on Report Driver and HVI rewrites. That we are currently having to decompile SZ webapp so we can connect login authentication for those, as well as be able to make fixes and/or any changes needed for it. We will keep working and I'll keep them updated on progress.


Tye F.

11:41
from SZ


Dmytro
  12:02 AM
@Tye F.
12:03
It is vb code, so it is old version
12:03
not friendly for user


Tye F.
  12:03 AM
Something to fix after rewrites?


Dmytro
  12:03 AM
so, we have developed web version
12:04
I think that your client using the web version from SZ are better than the old vb version. (edited) 
12:05
How do you think ?


Tye F.
  12:06 AM
Right. I will let them know.


Dmytro
  12:08 AM
If they want, they need to allow the port and create a domain to deploy the code.
12:08
because we have developed web version for today


Tye F.
  12:10 AM
I will let them know they need to wait


Dmytro
  12:13 AM
ok, please let them allow the port and create a domain to deploy the web version
12:14
for test and complete web version

"Sounds good,
We have the domain kioskprograms.thestaffzone.net where I would like to have a link/Button to each program you are rewriting. Kioskprograms.thestaffozne.net just has the disciplinary module you wrote.
I have ten Domains I can add to the SSL. They should be sitting on the kiosk server. If you think we need to add more resources to the server to accommodate the workload please let me know.
Currently kioskprograms.thestaffzone.net needs the connectors changed."

Dmytro
  12:02 AM
Finished connectors
12:03
But I can't see that platform on the server.
Where can I see it? (edited)

Okay, anyway, I'm working on making the 4 rewrite programs and the report driver work perfectly, so I need ports and domains to deploy and test the project.
The project requires a lot of domains.

4:43
"Can you take a look and let me know what you find please?
Just to let you know some of our on prem servers are offline, but the kiosk system should be completely in Azure. So if the cause is something still on prem then we need to figure it out and get it moved."


Dmytro
  4:45 PM
got it, let me check in detail


Tye F.
  6:11 PM
"Looks like it is working now. I turned on an on prem server that runs the DNS.
What DNS is being used for the web kiosk console?"


Dmytro
  6:52 PM
:sob:
6:53
It should be in the source code...
6:53
Let me try to get DNS


Tye F.
  6:56 PM
ok


Tye F.
  8:24 PM
"I’ve reinstalled logmein Please try your access."
8:24
for AVD


Dmytro
  11:58 PM
I have a question, why are you shutting down some servers?
image.png

Tye F.
  1:49 AM
I think because they moved them to azure


Dmytro
  9:07 AM
Hello, 
@Tye F.

National Customer Look up (95% complete, login authentication still remaining)
Rate Adjustment (93% complete, login authentication still remaining, some issues)
WOTC (93% complete, login authentication still remaining, some issues)
As you know, I am trying to get the source code.
It will take more time, decompiling is not easy, very difficult.
Without the source code, I can't do anything.
Staffing Depot
Kiosk Report issues
Kiosk Reset issue
Kiosk no doc issue
S50 and S52 Merge
Without the source code, we can't support the above projects and future clients in progress.
8:00
Once I get the source code, login authentication will be easy.
8:02
@Tye F.
 F. Right now, I need to work on getting the SOURCE CODE for the future and now!


Dmytro
  11:16 PM
Are you busy ?


Tye F.
  11:18 PM
What’s up?
11:18
I let the client know about status


Dmytro
  11:29 PM
ok, I will continue work.


Tye F.
  4:20 PM
Are you talking to me on Skype?


Dmytro
  4:22 PM
yea
4:22
Please chat there


Dmytro
  4:54 PM
Hey, I think you can grab several jobs in famous companies like FAANG with your ability.
:slightly_smiling_face: My friend was hired in Microsoft a few days ago...
4:54
Ofc, he is US. but I am not .,.. So I can't try...
4:55
Most of them needs citizenship and secret clearance...
4:56
I'd like to help you to seek high paid jobs and then we can work on your projects.
4:57
I think you can manage several jobs at the same time.


Tye F.
  4:57 PM
I’ve had bad experience with doing this in the past


Dmytro
  4:57 PM
What kind of bad exp?


Tye F.
  4:59 PM
It takes up so much of my time I have to be there in person for strategic meetings. It’s not scalable. Extremely stressful


Dmytro
  4:59 PM
What kind of roles did you apply?
5:00
software engineer role or manager role?
5:00
I think manager role takes too much time so it's not efficient.
5:00
but I think software engineer role is fine.
5:01
My friend works at Nike, Microsoft altogether... but he has enough spare time to have a rest.


Tye F.
  5:01 PM
My role was Head of Development


Dmytro
  5:01 PM
Ah, got it.
5:01
It will take too much time ... it needs design system, so many meetings...etc
5:01
I have some exp as before at local
5:02
So I decided to work as freelancer and made a group


Tye F.
  5:02 PM
I will only do anything through Webdevium. If I can work a deal through contract then it’s good


Dmytro
  5:02 PM
If you try to seek senior software engineer, it's very efficient.
5:03
Anyway, I can help you to seek several jobs
5:03
Do you wanna hear my plan or thoughts?


Tye F.
  5:04 PM
Yea I’m always open to ideas


Dmytro
  5:04 PM
haha
5:05
I will support to apply for jobs with your profile...
5:05
And if the hiring process start, you can pass them...
5:06
I think you have the ability to pass the technical interview...
5:06
If you are hired, we will work on your projects...
5:07
We can manage the chat... you only need to manage the meeting such as standup or weekly meetings...
5:07
What do you think?


Tye F.
  5:13 PM
I did this same thing for about 3 years before. I don’t think I will do it that way again


Dmytro
  5:13 PM
Ah, got it.
5:13
Thanks for your consideration.
5:14
Hope your company grow much bigger...
5:14
I'd like to be principle or staff engineer at your company.


Tye F.
  5:14 PM
I think there is opportunity in those positions that we can get their attention though


Dmytro
  5:15 PM
Do you have discussed with SZ client ?


Tye F.
  5:17 PM
Yea we ok good to keep working full time right now for SZ

Dmytro

11:46
But there are several versions of ReportDriver.exe.
11:46
The code version sent by the client is 2019 v.1.5.
11:47
There is also the old 2024 on server.
11:47
Anyway, this is the 2019 v.1.5 ReportDriver.exe that is working on HVI now.

Tye F.
  6:14 PM
how long to get source code?
6:14
client is getting anxious


Dmytro
  6:16 PM
I am doing best
6:16
But it's a very, very big project, as you know.
6:18
As I was working on it, I realized that the amount of code was enormous.
It was 3000 times more than the previous 4 rewrite projects.


Tye F.
  6:19 PM
I think it was only like 320hrs the first time we did it


Dmytro
  6:20 PM
wow
6:20
Really ?
6:20
Do you mean app.staffzone.com ?


Tye F.
  6:24 PM
I think I may have found the original files that they gave us 3 years ago
6:24
give me a bit


Dmytro
  6:27 PM
This is the vb code from app.staffzone.com so the code is 29.4MB. (edited) 
image.png
 
image.png
6:29
This is for EverifyAudit VB code and the code is 53kb.
image.png
 
image.png
6:29
around 500 times
6:30
Anyway, I don't think it will take that long.
6:30
Doing best...


Tye F.
  6:32 PM
what's ETA?


Dmytro
  6:33 PM
I think it will take at least two more months.
6:34
Actually it is minimum ETA


Tye F.
  6:34 PM
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yFKv37NiRIIe-4LOxqnI-DbCEolosbvq/view?usp=sharing
6:34
can you check these files as well please


Dmytro
  6:35 PM
If God helps, it could be shorter than that.
6:35
thanks I will check soon
6:36
Is it source code ? (edited) 


Tye F.
  6:50 PM
I think it's original code they provided us


Dmytro
  6:50 PM
give me a bit


Dmytro
  7:01 PM
It is all vb code, not web version
7:02
:sleepy:
7:02
:sob:


Tye F.
  7:02 PM
what code is the web version in right now?


Dmytro
  7:02 PM
asp.net
7:02
but, it's all vb code
7:03
And It's the code developed in 2020.


Tye F.
  7:03 PM
I mean the current version that is live right now


Dmytro
  7:04 PM
It is all asp.net code
7:05
When was the web version developed?


Tye F.
  7:07 PM
end of 2021


Dmytro
  7:08 PM
I think so. vb was developed in 2020.
7:09
@Tye F.
 We need time to provide ongoing support to our client. (edited) 
7:11
And we absolutely must get the code, or we will lose our client.


Tye F.
  7:11 PM
that's what we are trying to do


Dmytro
  7:13 PM
All the files you sent me are for design purposes and the VB one is outdated.


Tye F.
  7:14 PM
it looks like we completed the projects in 2 months, started in September 2021
7:14
image.png
 
image.png
7:14
then completed those 2 sites November


Dmytro
  7:15 PM
Is there any way to get some time from your client?


Tye F.
  7:15 PM
we need 8 weeks more?


Dmytro
  7:15 PM
yes, at least
7:16
possible ?


Tye F.
  7:16 PM
I think so
7:17
This was an update I sent them while we started working on it:
- Working on:
 New user registration
 Signature page
 Applicant Start page
 SkillsStart Page
 Skills Details page
 W4 pages
 Disciplinary pages
 Benefits pages


Dmytro
  7:20 PM
One file is almost one page and it is a project.
image.png
 
image.png
7:20
It seems like a whole project where last dev developed the first version and then added on requests from the client. (edited) 
7:22
Or maybe only some pages were converted.
7:23
@Tye F.
7:23
give me a PIN for auth
7:23
image.png
 
image.png
7:25
Can you ask about it ?


Tye F.
  7:32 PM
if you have VB code then you can create web version


Dmytro
  7:32 PM
haha right
7:32
but, I don't know about requirement for web version
7:32
It is different design and function
7:33
vb and current web version
7:34
I thin it is full version for web
7:34
As I told you, it is some pages in vb code
7:34
vb code have very many pages as I show you


Dmytro
  7:40 PM

are you busy ?


Dmytro
  7:55 PM
After logging in, let's check how many pages there are on that page.
7:55
If you want redevelop, then I will do it
7:56
But as I said, the code is 500x more EverifyAudit
7:56
I think it is not all, maybe implement some pages
7:59
Anyway, let's find the best solution together.
7:59
Don't worry, all we need is more time.

12:20

12:22

"You should be able to use the mselva@staffzone.com credentials to access it."


Tye F.
  6:32 PM
They want to have a call on Thursday at 1PM EST. So I will need you to be online to ask questions while I'm on there
6:33
Also this question: "why does the kiosk system go down when the CACO system is offline?, Eric thinks it may be connected to ldap?"


Dmytro
  6:34 PM
What is CACO ?


Tye F.
  6:36 PM
I will ask it


Tye F.
  6:43 PM
"Coulter Aviles and Company.
When we had a power incident and our Domain Control for CJB(CACO system) went down the web kiosk system couldn’t log in. I emailed you thinking it was something with the DNS but after talking with Eric it is more likely a hard coded LDAP or something. I’ll forward you the email chain we had about it. Subject line : FW: FW: Staff Zone KioskwebConsole
The two domains are connected through a VPN."
6:44
do you remember it?


Dmytro
  6:47 PM
I can check it out when I get the source code. I don't know how to code it.
6:47
Anyway,  I will think about it.


Tye F.
  10:36 PM
should I have them provide ldap source codes if they can get it on the call?


Dmytro
  11:22 PM
Yes, you should ask them to provide the LDAP source code or any related configuration files.


Dmytro
  4:45 PM
Good morning


Tye F.
  4:54 PM
